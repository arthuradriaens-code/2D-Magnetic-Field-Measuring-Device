Vincent had the idea of choosing a dutch word as acronym (e.g the english word PINGUIN standing for Plasma INteraction and GUIding ceNters). 

As I'm not very creative, I plan on using a bunch of words fitting the machine like:

antenna
measurement
field
electromagnetic
RF
motorized
...

And looping through all the dutch words in wordlist.txt until I encounter words I can use as acronyms.
