# First, Properties:

The platform needs to be able to cover a 2mx2m square with accurate positional precision and 
hold a ring to measure a magnetic field at a certain distance, thus it has to be very stable.
Ideally we'd like it to be able to handle a reasonable load (as we want to be open to modifications to the measurement device)
but this isn't necessary.

Due to the large size, the system will definitely have to be built out of metal-like components, 
for ease of use aluminium extrusions are the suggested frame building blocks.

## Moving Pieces:
### LeadScrew :
The screw which transforms rotary motion (from a stepper motor) to linear motion (up and down/ left and right).

Mogelijke lead screw: MTSRL16-2000 

This is a 16mm diameter 2m long lead screw, after testing the strength of lead screws of 10mm in diameter, this is definitely thick enough. 

Prijs = 82.16 euro x 2 = 164.32euro

### lead screw nut:
De "bout" die wordt bevestigd aan een platform dat dient te bewegen (de bout draait dus niet rond terwijl de schroef dat wel doet)

Mogelijke lead screw nut: MTSBHR20 

Prijs = 63.94 euro x 2 = 127.88 euro

### Rails:

SXRL-MX28-1900
Prijs = 288.25x4 = 1153 euro

### Lead screw support unit:

C-BRW20-SET: C-BRW20 + C-BUR20
prijs = 82.75x2 

Of BSW20 set

## Frame:

### Aluminium extrusions:

Mogelijke part: HFSP5-4040-1900
Prijs = 4x139.27 = 557.08

## Electronics:

### Circuit boards:

Arduino Uno; Prijs = 23,40euro
h2 stepper motor driver; Prijs = 37.77eurox2 = 75.54euro
Mean Well RS-15-24 power supply - 24V 15W; Prijs=€ 11,80x2 = 23,60euro

### Motors:
